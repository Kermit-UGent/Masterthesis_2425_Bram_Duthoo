    "id zal per definitie altijd een waarde hebben, daarnaast wordt er gefilterd op food_id waardoor dit ook altijd een waarde zal hebben. orig_food_id is de id van orig_food_common_name, nulwaarden hiervoor zijn dus niet problematisch zolang orig_food_common_name een waarde heeft. Deze worden gebruikt om binnenin de food_id een verdere distinctie te maken tussen verschillende onderdelen van het geheel, bv food_id 506 = beef & binnenin beef zijn er verschillende onderdelen zoals brisket, sirloin, minced meat, fat etc. orig_source_name & orig_source_id worden dan gebruikt om de verschillende componenten te kenmerken zoals glutamic acid, glucose etc. Source_type wordt gebruikt om een distinctie te maken tussen nutrients (FAT, PROTEIN, ...) & compounds (Glutamic acid, glucose, ...). Orig_content, orig_unit & standard_content worden gebruikt om de waarde van elke nutrient/compound te bewaren en quantificeren. Tenslotte blijft source_id over wat nog steeds een compleet mysterie voor me blijft, de naam lijkt belangrijk, maar ik kan geen enkele connectie vinden met een andere parameter en ik heb nog geen antwoord ontvangen van de eigenaars van de database."
